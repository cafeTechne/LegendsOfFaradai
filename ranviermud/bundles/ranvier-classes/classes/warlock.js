        description: "Warlocks are Sorcerers born with latent access to magical techniques negating Blood Magic. Warlocks and reverse the direction of draining magic, essentially making Set'tari fiends donate their life when they attempt to drain the vitae from their victims. Warlocks have the ability to weigh down the blood of a blood magic user, making evading their onslaught of wand attacks perfectly attuned to maximize damage against blood magic users practically impossible. \n These abilities are derived from meta-magical genetic symmetry and harmony and deal with interfering with the special cases on which blood magic depends to elicit it's intended effects. This is thought of as an adaptation which conferred their ancestors with the ability to thrive under the harshest years of the ancient regime from which the Sorcerer's earliest ancestors escaped in the great migration. Warlocks are an incredibly paranoid bunch, prone to concocting conspiracy theories and seeing enemies where there are none. They are dedicated to staying alive and tend to lie low or band together in cabals. Warlocks across the globe are mounting a resistance against the Elenori and the Set'tari--both of whom, even though they have a bitter enmity and ancient territorial and ideological feuds between their selves, secretly cooperate in attempts to exterminate the Warlock bloodline.",
